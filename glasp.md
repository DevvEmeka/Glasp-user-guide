As we read content online for research, study, or casual reading, we read people’s stories, learn from them, and get inspired. These findings from our online experience equip us with knowledge. But sometimes, it could be working in futility since we can easily lose touch with this knowledge or the stories that inspired us. And this is where I introduce Glasp, a social web highlighter that has perfected ways to transform people’s online experience.

Glasp is a productivity app for writers, students, avid readers, and researchers. It gives you the creative freedom to highlight ideas and text in an organised manner so your followers can easily connect with you in real-time through available, visually appealing quotes. Glasp helps you highlight and organise information, then collates them onto your Glasp homepage. You can share your highlights across social media platforms, adding more meaning to your articles or online content. 

## `What Is Glasp?`
Glasp is a social web highlighter that lets you capture online content in a variety of colours, which is then curated to your homepage. With Glasp, you can recapture your highlighted text, search, make notes alongside, and take a quote shot that you can share across other platforms like Twitter, Teams, Slack, and other note-taking applications.
You can add a tag to your highlighted quote using the add tag feature to give each highlight more meaning and context. The add tag feature has a well-functioning sidebar where you can add your thoughts and findings and leave a note alongside the captured quote.

## `Why You Should Use Glasp`
Using Glasp provides many benefits, some of which are highlighted below.

### `Become a Knowledge Curator`
Glasp as a tool provides an environment where you can highlight contents that piques your interest, and these highlights are curated automatically to your Glasp homepage. With Glasp, you can organise ideas, research, quotes, and inspiration on its homepage and use this curated knowledge to spark your creativity.

### `Enhance Online Learning`
Whether you are an avid reader, student, researcher, or just browsing the web searching for information, Glasp has got you covered. Glasp is the best tool to curate knowledge while enjoying online content without distractions, like going to a note-taking app to jot down points or ideas. All you have to do is drag your cursor over the piece of text you want to capture, save it, and get the captured text resurfaced at your convenience.

### `Amplifies Content Reach`
Glasp is like a knowledge box for your online content. It allows you to leverage social media by sharing what you learned, fostering engagement with your post, and motivating your followers through the knowledge you gained from reading or watching online content. It also allows you to keep notes alongside the captured text and use them on your projects and articles or share them on various social media platforms.

### `Improve Your Productivity`
Glasp will transform your learning habits and how you approach information gathering. It eases your learning process and removes the burden of remembering every fact and figure you find online. You can use Glasp's hit map for capturing to keep track of your activities and the knowledge you’ve gathered over a period. You derive pleasure when you log in every day to read topics tailored for you, connect with a community of thinkers, and stay motivated and productive at the same time.

### `Transform Your Research Experience`
You can trust Glasp to aid your research process and you won't be disappointed. Writing a research paper or an article requires that you cite your sources. As you research and read articles online, Glasp will help you organise your findings and what you have learned so you can get back to them later.

It also comes with some social elements, as you can connect with like-minded people by following each other and sharing knowledge.

People are likely to use software with an impressive design and a good user experience. Glasp is not left behind in this aspect due to its simplicity and flexibility. It's user-friendly, with a fantastic layout and other helpful features that keep users engaged and productive at the same time.

It has a navigation bar that displays your favourite highlights, articles, pages, and authors of the articles.
